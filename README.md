⚙️ Scheduling Algorithm
The heart of this system is the scheduling algorithm, which ensures appointments are allocated efficiently. Here’s how it works:

📥 Input: Doctor availability, user preferences, and appointment duration.

🔄 Processing: The algorithm checks for overlapping appointments and assigns the nearest available slot.

📤 Output: A confirmed appointment slot or alternative suggestions if the preferred slot is unavailable.
